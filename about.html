                <div>Hi there! My name is NIKHIL PATIL and I am currently completed a PG course CDAC from CDAC NEW DELHI. I am excited to connect with professionals in the field of software development, particularly those with expertise in Java, React, .NET and Springboot.

                    As a student of CDAC, I have been exposed to a range of technologies and tools in the software development space, but I have found myself particularly drawn to Java, React, and Springboot. These technologies offer immense potential to create efficient and scalable software applications, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in these areas.
